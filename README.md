# 🔮 perplexity-visibility-checker

**See whether Perplexity cites your brand — live.**

Perplexity answers every question with a ranked list of **sources**. That list
*is* the game: if your domain isn't on it, you don't exist at the moment your
buyer is deciding.

Type your brand and a buyer question. This tool runs a **real, live Perplexity
session** (via Bright Data's Perplexity scraper) and tells you whether you were:

- **Cited** as a source (and at what rank),
- **Named** in the answer text, or
- **Invisible** — with the exact ranked sources Perplexity trusts instead.

## How it works

```
Browser ──► Cloudflare Worker (same-origin proxy) ──► Bright Data Perplexity scraper
   ▲                                                          │
   └──────────  answer + ranked sources + verdict  ◄──────────┘
```

1. You enter a **brand**, a **buyer question**, a **location**, and **your own
   Bright Data token**.
2. The Worker calls the Perplexity scraper (`gd_m7dhdot1vw9a7gc1n`) via the
   synchronous `/scrape` endpoint; it usually returns the result inline (~30s),
   falling back to a snapshot ID the page polls for slower runs.
3. It renders the answer, the ranked source list, "people also ask", and a result.
4. Export as Markdown, JSON, or CSV.

| Engine | Dataset ID | Key inputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Perplexity | `gd_m7dhdot1vw9a7gc1n` | `url, prompt, country, index` |

Perplexity answers are built around a ranked source list, so it's usually the
clearest place to see whether your domain is cited — when the model returns
sources at all (occasionally it returns none).

## Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) — zero secrets

**There is no API token in this repo or in the deployed Worker.** Each visitor
pastes their **own** Bright Data token; it's forwarded per request to Bright Data
and **not stored on our servers** (the Worker keeps no database and doesn't log
the token). If you tick **"Remember in this browser"**, it's saved only in your
browser's `localStorage`; otherwise it isn't persisted anywhere. Your key, your
credits — each check spends a few cents of **your own** Bright Data balance, and
`POST /api/check` is rate-limited per IP. (A proxy is needed only because Bright
Data's API doesn't send CORS headers, so a browser can't call it directly.)

Create a Bright Data account at [brightdata.com](https://brightdata.com); the API
token lives in your account settings under *API keys*.

## Run it yourself

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:8787
npm run deploy     # deploy to your Cloudflare account
```

No secrets to configure. Click **"See a real sample"** to view a real result for
*ROASPIG* without using a token.

### Raw API example (synchronous)

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BRIGHT_DATA_API_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":[{"url":"https://www.perplexity.ai","prompt":"best AI ad creative tools in 2026","country":"US","index":1}]}' \
  "https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/scrape?dataset_id=gd_m7dhdot1vw9a7gc1n&notify=false&include_errors=true"
```

(For long jobs use the async pattern: `POST /datasets/v3/trigger` → poll
`GET /datasets/v3/progress/{id}` → download `GET /datasets/v3/snapshot/{id}?format=json`.)
