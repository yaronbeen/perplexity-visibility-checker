**See whether Perplexity cites your brand — live.**

### ▶ Try it now: **[perplexity-visibility-checker.yaron-been.workers.dev](https://perplexity-visibility-checker.yaron-been.workers.dev)**

No install and no sign-up here — bring your own Bright Data key, type your brand
and a question, and get a verdict in your browser. (Or click **"See a real
sample"** to view a captured result with no key at all.)

[![The perplexity-visibility-checker interface](docs/screenshot.png)](https://perplexity-visibility-checker.yaron-been.workers.dev)

Perplexity answers every question with a ranked list of **sources**. That list
*is* the game: if your domain isn't on it, you don't exist at the moment your
buyer is deciding.

Type your brand and a buyer question. This tool runs your question through
Perplexity live (via Bright Data's Perplexity dataset) and tells you whether you were:

- **Cited** as a source (and at what rank),
- **Named** in the answer text, or
- **Invisible** — with the exact ranked sources Perplexity trusts instead.

## How it works

```
Browser ──► Cloudflare Worker (same-origin proxy) ──► Bright Data Perplexity scraper
   ▲                                                          │
   └──────────  answer + ranked sources + verdict  ◄──────────┘
```

1. You enter a **brand**, a **buyer question**, a **location**, and **your own
   Bright Data token**.
2. The Worker triggers the Perplexity scraper (`gd_m7dhdot1vw9a7gc1n`) via the
   asynchronous `/datasets/v3/trigger` endpoint, which returns a `snapshot_id`
   immediately (no held-open connection, so no edge timeouts). The page then
   polls `/api/status` until ready and fetches the record from `/api/result`
   (typically ~30–60s total).
3. It renders the answer, the ranked source list, "people also ask", and a result.
4. Export as Markdown, JSON, or CSV.

| Engine | Dataset ID | Key inputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Perplexity | `gd_m7dhdot1vw9a7gc1n` | `url, prompt, country, index` |

Perplexity answers are built around a ranked source list, so it's usually the
clearest place to see whether your domain is cited — when the model returns
sources at all (occasionally it returns none).

## Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) — zero secrets

**There is no API token in this repo or in the deployed Worker.** Each visitor
pastes their **own** Bright Data token; it's forwarded per request to Bright Data
and **not stored anywhere** — the Worker keeps no database, doesn't log the token,
and the page does not save it in your browser (no `localStorage`, no cookies).
Your key, your credits — each check uses about **US$0.0015 per record** of **your
own** Bright Data pay-as-you-go balance, and the `/api/*` endpoints are
rate-limited per IP. (A proxy is needed only because Bright Data's API doesn't
send CORS headers, so a browser can't call it directly.)

Create a Bright Data account at [brightdata.com](https://brightdata.com); the API
token lives in your account settings under *API keys*. New accounts include free
trial credit, so you can try this without spending anything.

## Run it yourself

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:8787
npm run deploy     # deploy to your Cloudflare account
```

No secrets to configure. Click **"See a real sample"** to view a real result for
*ROASPIG* without using a token.

### Raw API example

The app uses the **asynchronous** flow: trigger a job, get a `snapshot_id` back
immediately, poll progress, then download the snapshot.

```bash
# 1. trigger — returns { "snapshot_id": "sd_..." }
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BRIGHT_DATA_API_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":[{"url":"https://www.perplexity.ai","prompt":"best AI ad creative tools in 2026","country":"US","index":1}]}' \
  "https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/trigger?dataset_id=gd_m7dhdot1vw9a7gc1n&notify=false&include_errors=true"

# 2. poll until status is "ready"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BRIGHT_DATA_API_TOKEN" "https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/progress/sd_..."

# 3. download the record
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BRIGHT_DATA_API_TOKEN" "https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/snapshot/sd_...?format=json"
```

## Tests

The pure logic (brand matching, citation parsing, CSV/HTML escaping) lives in
`public/lib.js`, which the page imports as a module **and** the tests import
directly — so the suite exercises the exact code that ships. The Worker is tested
by driving its `fetch` handler with mock requests and a stubbed `fetch`/`env`
(no network, no token needed).

```bash
npm test        # node --test — zero dependencies
```

CI runs the same command on every push and pull request
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## What to do with a "no"

An invisible verdict isn't a dead end — it's a target list. The ranked sources
Perplexity returned are the pages it already trusts, so that list *is* your
to-do list: get featured on the ones that fit your brand, ideally near the top,
phrased as one clean, quotable sentence a model can lift word for word. You don't
optimize the model; you optimize what it retrieves. The full playbook is in the
[article that inspired this](https://medium.com/@yaron.been/my-saas-was-invisible-to-chatgpt-i-built-a-scraping-pipeline-to-fix-it-4703bbed2345).
